## About

Eleganta is a simple PHP MVC framework. 
Eleganta also comes with a custom templating engine to make building pages easier.

Eleganta was creating as a learning exercise. I first learned PHP from this [Object Oriented PHP](https://www.udemy.com/course/object-oriented-php-mvc/) Course. During the course, I build a PHP framework. I wanted to improve the framework, as well as consolidate what I learned in the course.

## Features

- Route methods that support different request methods, and URL parameters.
- Middleware
- Templating engine
- MVC design pattern
